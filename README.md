## TODO: Added files form the server and other machines

# Dotfiles
A repo to manage my dotfiles. 

This README file is made to make it easier for you if you wish to use my config.

## Dotfiles included
* **.vimrc** Vim config
* **.tmux.conf** Tmux config

## Setup
To setup everything correctly, run the setup.sh script, which will make symbolic links to the files in the home dir
```bash
./setup.sh
```
You might also need to give the setup.sh script execute permission before running,
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```
