# dotfiles
A repo to manage my dotfiles

## Dotfiles included
* **.vimrc**
* **.tmux.conf**

## Setup
To setup everything correctly, run the setup.sh script, which will make symbolic links to the files in the home dir
```bash
./setup.sh
```
You might also need to give the setup.sh script execute permission before running,
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```
